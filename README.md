# Rice_HxD_Metabolomics
Workflow for statistical analysis of GC-MS data from field-grown rice exposed to combined drought and heat stress

Experimental design: 
three-year field experiment;
three rice cultivars with different tolerance to drought and heat stress used;
combined drought and heat stress imposed at either the flowering or early grain-filling stage;
flag leaves, flowering spikelets, and developing seeds collected from control and combined drought and heat stress treatments;
samples collected at different time points (mild stress, late stress, 12 h after rewatering, 36 h after rewatering, 60 h after rewatering
